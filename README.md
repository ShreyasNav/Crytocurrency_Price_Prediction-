# Basic methodology
We have used Mistral AI for image analysis of images in a tweet and coverted it to text
FinBERT to get sentiment scores from the text in a tweet and the text converted from image of a tweet
Then the OHLCV data and the sentiment scores are put as features to a Time Transformer model that predicts closing price
